# Data Science and Machine Learning exercises


The purpose of this repository is to serve like a database of solved exercises I did to learn about data science and machine learning, I keep learning so maybe I'll upload another more. Also, I will start doing projects but they'll be uploaded in other repositories.

Note: Currently, the repo only has exercises from mlcourse.ai course.
